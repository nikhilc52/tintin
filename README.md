# Computer Vision with Tintin

This project uses 21 Tintin graphic novels (1,000+ pages and 16,000+ panels) with computer vision models to analyze character appearances.

## Sources and Inspiration

- [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/): I used this site to obtain the actual books that I used for analysis
- [Tintin in the Data World](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/rincon/viz/TintinintheDataWorld/EntryPage): Tableau dashboard that inspired some data visualizations created
- [Yolo Model Training Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r0RspiLG260): Tutorial that I found very useful when parsing data and training my model
- [Who's in the Crossword](https://pudding.cool/2020/11/crossword/): Article I used for visual inspiration for the blog webpage design

## Built With

- **Python** (ultralytics)
  - Used to train both panel and person models and make predictions on new data
- **R** (tidyverse, ggplot)
  - I used R (and its packages) to make references for most of the plots displayed on the website and general data exploration
- **Adobe Illustrator**
  - Used for the design of some plots and charts used in the article
- **Vanilla HTML/CSS**
  - Used to design and create the website for the write-up
